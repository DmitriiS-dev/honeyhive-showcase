## 📝 What’s This All About?

HoneyHive is a full-stack e-commerce app for premium, locally sourced honey.  
Think Amazon, but for bees — and way more charming.

Built for UK users, it includes things like real-time product reservations (so no one steals your honey mid-checkout), UK-specific shipping checks, and a clean, multi-step checkout.

## 🛠 Under the Hood

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Spring Boot (Java), MySQL  
- **Testing:** Playwright (E2E), JUnit (backend)  
- **DevOps:** GitLab CI/CD and Kubernetes (soon)

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔐 User login, signup, and sessions
- 🐝 Product reservation to prevent honey theft (you know who you are)
- 💳 Multi-step checkout with payment integration (stripe coming soon...)
- 📦 Inventory + order management
- 📮 Shipping validation (UK only — sorry, rest of the world!)

## 👨‍💻 What I Did

- Designed and built the full-stack architecture
- Wrote both the pretty frontend and the serious backend
- Automated tests
- Set up GitLab CI/CD
- Basically... wore every hat 🧢🐝

## 🐝 The Buzz

This project is part tech demo, part business experiment. It’s fast, tested, and built to scale.  
A real-world e-commerce setup with room to grow — and maybe even launch.
