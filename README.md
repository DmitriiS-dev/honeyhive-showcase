## 📝 What’s This All About?

HoneyHive is a full-stack e-commerce app for premium, locally sourced honey.  
Think Amazon, but for bees — and way more charming.

Built for UK users, it includes things like real-time product reservations (so no one steals your honey mid-checkout), UK-specific shipping checks, and a clean, multi-step checkout.
